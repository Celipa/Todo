We were assigned in JavaScript 1 to create a To-do Task List with an api custom built by our teacher.

The assignment was to:
- Create a form that allows the user to add a task.
- Use Fetch to get Tasks from the API with a GET request
- Save tasks to the database when Adding a task to the API with a POST request
- Have validation for Unchecked tasks so they cannot be deleted
- Checked tasks should send a completed: true boolean to the api with a PUT request
- Have a validation where if a task is unchecked, it cannot be deleted.
- Delete a task from the API with a DELETE request
